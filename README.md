## âœ… Task 1: Downtime Analysis Dashboard (Tableau Public)

**Objective:**  
Analyze telemetry data from 4 factories (Daikibo) to identify which factory had the most machine breakdowns, and which machines failed most often.

**Objective:**  
Classify employee equality scores into defined categories using Excel logic.

**Original Dataset Columns:**
